Abstract

   Open source projects rely on the cooperation of third parties.  Other
   websites also rely on user feedback, for example, when bugs occur.
   There are various platforms that enable effective collaboration.
   However, this diversity also presents a challenge.  Where should
   users who have discovered an error report it?  Or how can third
   parties participate in a project?  This document presents one way to
   communicate such information in a consistent manner.

1.  Introduction

   Currently, there are various platforms for collaboration on projects
   or communication with users of websites, services and so on.  This
   creates opportunities, for example in open source projects, to work
   with contributors and exchange information.  However, such
   opportunities differ from project to project.  Users who are
   interested in participating in a project need to be aware of these
   different procedures.  This can be a challenge due to the
   inconsistent form of the information and might also lead to users
   deciding not to participate because they cannot find a contact point.

   At the same time, there is a need for "bug reports" in other forms of
   websites as well.  Users are expected to point out bugs to the person
   in charge and thus lead to a better user experience for all users.
   Unfortunately, the ways and procedures for such "bug reports" also
   differ from website to website.  These differences mean that users
   might not be able to find a contact person to report a bug, and thus
   fail to report it.

   The goal of this document and the proposed form of communication in
   the "contributing.txt" file is:

   1.  to provide open source or similar projects with the opportunity
       to inform interested parties about the possibilities of
       contributing.

   2.  to offer any kind of website the possibility to define a contact
       person for bug reports etc.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The Specification

   This document defines a file called "contributing.txt", which
   provides information about possible contribution to a project or
   website.  The file format of "contributing.txt" MUST be plain text
   (MIME type "text/plain") (Section 4.1.3 of [RFC2046]) and MUST be
   encoded using UTF-8 ([RFC3629]).

   The file "contributing.txt" MUST be placed directly under the domain
   (for example: https://example.com/contributing.txt).

   The file "contributing.txt" MUST contain at least:

   *  Paragraph "Admin" with the name of the administrator or the
      webmaster.

   *  Paragraph "Bugs" with a mail address or a web address to report
      bugs.

   Example:

   Admin: Valentin Binotto
   Bugs: bugs@example.com

   OPTIONALLY the following paragraphs can be added to the
   "contributing.txt" file:

   *  Paragraph "Open Source" with a web address to a suitable platform
      for third party collaboration (for example github.com or
      gitlab.com).

   *  Paragraph "License" with information about the license that
      applies to the content of the website.

   *  Paragraph "Guidelines" with a web address to the guidelines for
      contributing to this project.

   Example:

   Open Source: github.com/valentinbinotto
   License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Int. Public License
   Guidelines: github.com/valentinbinotto/v434/guidelines.txt

   OPTIONALLY, comments can be added to the "contributing.txt" file.
   Each line of the comment must start with "#" (%x23).

   Example:

   # Hello, world!

   The specified paragraphs MUST be placed in the specified order:

   1.  Admin

   2.  Bugs

   3.  Open Source

   4.  License

   5.  Guidelines

   6.  (Comments)

   Only one entry is allowed per paragraph

   However, paragraphs can be reused an unlimited number of times, as
   long as the order of the paragraphs is still as specified.

   Example for a "contributing.txt" file:

   Admin: Valentin Binotto
   Bugs: bugs@example.com
   Open Source: github.com/valentinbinotto
   License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Int. Public License
   Guidelines: github.com/valentinbinotto/v434/guidelines.txt
   # Hello, world!

4.  Security Considerations

   Because of the use of URIs, security considerations of [RFC3986]
   apply here.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
