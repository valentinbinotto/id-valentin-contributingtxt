--- abstract

Open source projects rely on the cooperation of third parties.  Other websites also rely on user feedback, for example, when bugs occur. There are various platforms that enable effective collaboration. However, this diversity also presents a challenge. Where should users who have discovered an error report it? Or how can third parties participate in a project? This document presents one way to communicate such information in a consistent manner.

# Introduction

TODO Currently, there are various platforms for collaboration on projects or communication with users of websites, services and so on. This creates opportunities, for example in open source projects, to work with contributors and exchange information. However, such opportunities differ from project to project. Users who are interested in participating in a project need to be aware of these different procedures. This can be a challenge due to the inconsistent form of the information and might also lead to users deciding not to participate because they cannot find a contact point. 

At the same time, there is a need for "bug reports" in other forms of websites as well. Users are expected to point out bugs to the person in charge and thus lead to a better user experience for all users. Unfortunately, the ways and procedures for such "bug reports" also differ from website to website. These differences mean that users might not be able to find a contact person to report a bug, and thus fail to report it.

The goal of this document and the proposed form of communication in the "contributing.txt" file is:

- to provide open source or similar projects with the opportunity to inform interested parties about the possibilities of contributing.
- to offer any kind of web site the possibility to define a contact person for bug reports etc.
